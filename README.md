# BuildAccess
https://devpost.com/software/build-access-app. 
We created the BuildAccess app at the BuildHer Hackathon to allow users to view and add accessibility information about their college campuses. We used Ionic for the frontend framework and Firebase with AngularFire2 for the backend. We were inspired by the fact that many of the buildings on our campuses are not particularly accessible. We made this app to improve overall awareness of accessibility concerns and increase pressure for campus admins to make change.
